# Environment Variables Setup - Complete ✅

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Environment Files
- **`.env`** - Contains your actual Supabase credentials (not committed to git)
- **`.env.example`** - Template file for other developers (committed to git)
- **`ENV_SETUP.md`** - Documentation for environment setup

### 2. Updated Files

#### Added Dependencies
- Added `flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0` to `pubspec.yaml`
- Added `.env` to assets in `pubspec.yaml`

#### Created Configuration
- Created `lib/config/env_config.dart` - Helper class to access environment variables

#### Updated Services
- Updated `lib/services/supabase_service.dart` - Now uses environment variables instead of hardcoded keys
- Updated `lib/main.dart` - Loads environment variables on app startup

#### Security
- Updated `.gitignore` - Prevents `.env` file from being committed to version control

### 3. File Structure
```
flutter_application_5/
├── .env                           # Your actual credentials (not in git)
├── .env.example                   # Template (in git)
├── ENV_SETUP.md                   # Setup documentation
├── lib/
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── env_config.dart        # Environment config helper
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── supabase_service.dart  # Updated to use env vars
│   └── main.dart                  # Updated to load env vars
├── pubspec.yaml                   # Added flutter_dotenv package
└── .gitignore                     # Updated to exclude .env

```

## How It Works

1. **App Startup**: `main.dart` loads `.env` file using `flutter_dotenv`
2. **Validation**: `EnvConfig.validate()` checks all required variables are set
3. **Access**: Services use `EnvConfig.supabaseUrl` and `EnvConfig.supabaseAnonKey`
4. **Security**: `.env` is excluded from git, so credentials stay private

## Benefits

✅ **Security**: API keys are no longer hardcoded in source code
✅ **Flexibility**: Easy to switch between development/production environments
✅ **Best Practice**: Follows industry standard for managing secrets
✅ **Team Collaboration**: Team members can use their own credentials
✅ **Git Safety**: Credentials won't be accidentally committed

## Usage

### For You (Current Developer)
Your `.env` file is already set up with your Supabase credentials. No action needed!

### For Other Developers
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Replace placeholders with actual Supabase credentials
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Run the app

### For Different Environments
Create multiple env files:
- `.env.development` - Development credentials
- `.env.production` - Production credentials
- `.env.staging` - Staging credentials

Load different files based on environment:
```dart
await dotenv.load(fileName: ".env.production");
```

## Testing

Run the app to verify everything works:
```bash
flutter run
```

If you see "Supabase init completed", the environment variables are loaded correctly!

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Never commit `.env` file** - It's already in `.gitignore`
⚠️ **Don't share credentials publicly** - Use secure channels
⚠️ **Rotate keys if exposed** - Generate new keys from Supabase dashboard

## Next Steps

Consider adding more environment variables for:
- API endpoints
- Feature flags
- Third-party service keys
- Debug/production mode flags

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "SUPABASE_URL is not set"
- Make sure `.env` file exists in project root
- Check that `.env` is added to `assets` in `pubspec.yaml`
- Run `flutter pub get` after making changes

### Error: "Failed to load .env file"
- Verify `.env` file is in the correct location (project root)
- Check file permissions
- Ensure file is not corrupted

### Keys not working
- Verify keys are copied correctly from Supabase dashboard
- Check for extra spaces or quotes around values
- Ensure keys are valid and not expired
