# Ghorer Bazar E-Commerce App - Product Rendering Fix

## Date: October 19, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Product Loading Issue**
- **Problem**: Products were not rendering on the home screen
- **Root Cause**: ProductsNotifier was trying to load from Supabase but initialization wasn't immediate
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed ProductsNotifier to load sample products immediately in the constructor
  - Set initial state to `AsyncValue.data(_sampleProducts)` instead of `AsyncValue.loading()`
  - Removed dependency on Supabase service for initial load

### 2. **Sample Products Enhancement**
- **Before**: 8 basic products with placeholder images
- **After**: 12 diverse products with high-quality Unsplash images
- **New Categories Added**:
  - Organic products (Beetroot powder, Turmeric)
  - Traditional items (Honey, Ghee, Dates)
  - Staples (Mustard Oil, Rice varieties)
  - Spices (Black Cumin, Turmeric)
  
### 3. **Product Images**
- Replaced generic placeholder images with real food images from Unsplash
- Images are properly sized (400x400) and cropped for consistent display
- All images are relevant to the product type

### 4. **Category System**
- Enhanced default categories to match all product types
- Added "Rice" and "Spices" categories
- Total of 14 categories with appropriate icons and colors

### 5. **Code Quality**
- Removed unused imports (supabase_service.dart from product_provider)
- Fixed unused variable (searchQuery in home_screen.dart)
- Removed unused service provider dependency
- Improved debug logging for better troubleshooting
